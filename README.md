# In this Homework, we use the tools to set up a simulated blockchain and execute transactions. 

1: Download the file geth-alltools-linux-amd64-1.9.7 from https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.

2: Unzip the file (depending on your OS)

3: Ensure that the applications geth, and puppeth are in the uncompressed folder 

4: Execute the following commands: 
  ./geth --datadir node1 account new
  ./geth --datadir node2 account new
  Where node1 and node2 will be the new directories that will be created to hold the newly created blockchain node information. 

5: Follow the instructions for setting up the nodes using the prompts as shown in the following screenshot: 



  
For this homework, the node1 and node2 addresses are:

NODE 1
Public address of the key:   0x066f81B90B11FdCE0323eBAF79dA4BEb8C01a0D5
Path of the secret key file: node1/keystore/UTC--2021-10-10T23-07-48.876839289Z--066f81b90b11fdce0323ebaf79da4beb8c01a0d5

NODE 2
Public address of the key:   0xCB211eaC05270fc3Be62fF671654f14be76AD734
